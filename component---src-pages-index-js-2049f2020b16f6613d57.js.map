When I was young, I\n          would stay up all night working on my music videos in Adobe Premiere,\n          saving every 10 minutes to avoid losing all my data in a program crash\n          (despite it taking 2 minutes each save). Things have gotten a lot\n          better in that realm, and I have been eagerly awaiting each upgrade to\n          computer hardware. Naturally I transitioned into gaming, which I still\n          do on occasion but not nearly as fanatically as I did in my youth.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Lately I've switched to a lot of off-computer hobbies, like guitar,\n          camping and reading. I mostly read fiction, particularly grimdark\n          fantasy. I'm also a follower of Neuroscience, Psychology, and\n          Philosophy so I read books on those topics as well. I'm super hyped\n          about VR, and own a Vive and an Oculus Rift.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"row\">\n          <div className=\"columns contact-details\">\n            <h2>Contact
