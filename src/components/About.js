        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I've been a computer enuthusiast most of my life. When I was young, I
          would stay up all night working on my music videos in Adobe Premiere,
          saving every 10 minutes to avoid losing all my data in a program crash
          (despite it taking 2 minutes each save). Things have gotten a lot
          better in that realm, and I have been eagerly awaiting each upgrade to
          computer hardware. Naturally I transitioned into gaming, which I still
          do on occasion but not nearly as fanatically as I did in my youth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately I've switched to a lot of off-computer hobbies, like guitar,
          camping and reading. I mostly read fiction, particularly grimdark
          fantasy. I'm also a follower of Neuroscience, Psychology, and
          Philosophy so I read books on those topics as well. I'm super hyped
          about VR, and own a Vive and an Oculus Rift.
